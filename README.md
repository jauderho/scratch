# scratch

It turns out that there is no actual `scratch` image which makes it difficult to provide a container image hash. This aims to fix that.

## Usage

`FROM ghcr.io/jauderho/scratch:latest@sha256:e8ed3e52ddb3dbb203c117b2587fee3dc24656dcca78f01c4a5862d1eb603804`

or 

`FROM ghcr.io/jauderho/scratch:1.0.0@sha256:e8ed3e52ddb3dbb203c117b2587fee3dc24656dcca78f01c4a5862d1eb603804`
